The Linux Filesystem is organized in a tree-like hierarchy, following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) maintained by the Linux Foundation. The latest version is 3.0.3, released in June 2015.
 
**Debian-based** and **Red Hat-based** distributions share similarities in their filesystem hierarchy, The main differences lie in package management systems and certain configuration file locations. Debian-based distros use .deb packages and tools like apt, while Red Hat-based distros use .rpm packages and tools like yum or dnf. Hereâ€™s a brief comparison:

| Debian-based Filesystem Hierarchy |  Red Hat-based Filesystem Hierarchy |
|----------|----------|
| Root Directory: / | Root Directory: / |
| User Binaries: /bin and /usr/bin | User Binaries: /bin and /usr/bin |
| System Binaries: /sbin and /usr/sbin | System Binaries: /sbin and /usr/sbin |
| Configuration Files: /etc | Configuration Files: /etc |
| User Home Directories: /home | User Home Directories: /home |
| Libraries: /lib, /usr/lib, and /lib64 | Libraries: /lib, /usr/lib, and /lib64 |
| Temporary Files: /tmp | Temporary Files: /tmp |
| Optional Software: /opt | Optional Software: /opt |
| Process Information: /proc | Process Information: /proc |
| Mount Points: /mnt and /media | Mount Points: /mnt and /media |
| Devices: /dev | Devices: /dev |
| Logs: /var/log | Logs: /var/log |


The Linux Filesystem structure begins with the root directory, which is the highest directory in the hierarchy. It contains all other directories and subdirectories on the system.

To get a better picture of this, navigate to the root directory / and run the following command:
```sh
tree -D -L 1
