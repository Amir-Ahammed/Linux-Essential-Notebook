## IP Address Configuration using Netplan on Ubuntu
Configuring an IP address on an Ubuntu server can be done using Netplan, which is the default network management tool for Ubuntu 17.10 and later versions. Here’s a step-by-step guide to manually assign a static IP address:

**Step 1: Identify Your Network Interface** - 
First, you need to identify the name of your network interface. Open a terminal and run:
```
ip link
```
Look for your network interface (e.g., ens33).

**Step 2: Backup Your Configuration File** - 
Netplan configuration file located in `` /etc/netplan/``. You might find a file named ``01-netcfg.yaml`` or ``50-cloud-init.yaml``. Before making any changes, it's a good practice to backup the original configuration file. You can do this by running:
``` 
sudo cp /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml.bak
```

**Step 3: Edit the Netplan Configuration File** - 
Open the Netplan configuration file by useing a text editor like vim:
```
sudo vim /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

**Step 4: Add Your Configuration** - 
Add or update the configuration for your network interface. Here’s an example configuration:
```
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.1.10/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
```
Or
```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    ens33:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses:
        - 192.168.10.250/24
      gateway4: 192.168.10.1
      nameservers:
          addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
```
Replace ens33 with your actual network interface name, and adjust the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers as needed.

**Step 4: Apply the Configuration** - 
Save the file and exit the text editor. Then apply the changes with:
```
sudo netplan apply
```

**Step 5: Verify the Configuration** - 
Check if the IP address has been assigned correctly:
```
ip a
```
