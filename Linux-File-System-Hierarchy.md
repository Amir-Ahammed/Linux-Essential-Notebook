The Linux Filesystem is organized in a tree-like hierarchy, following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) maintained by the Linux Foundation. The latest version is 3.0.3, released in June 2015. **Debian-based** and **Red Hat-based** distributions share similarities in their filesystem hierarchy, but there are some notable differences. Hereâ€™s a brief comparison:
#### Debian-based Filesystem Hierarchy
* Root Directory: /
* User Binaries: /bin and /usr/bin
* System Binaries: /sbin and /usr/sbin
* Configuration Files: /etc
* User Home Directories: /home
* Libraries: /lib, /usr/lib, and /lib64
* Temporary Files: /tmp
* Optional Software: /opt
* Process Information: /proc
* Mount Points: /mnt and /media
* Devices: /dev
* Logs: /var/log

#### Red Hat-based Filesystem Hierarchy

* Root Directory: /
* User Binaries: /bin and /usr/bin
* System Binaries: /sbin and /usr/sbin
* Configuration Files: /etc
* User Home Directories: /home
* Libraries: /lib, /usr/lib, and /lib64
* Temporary Files: /tmp
* Optional Software: /opt
* Process Information: /proc
* Mount Points: /mnt and /media
* Devices: /dev
* Logs: /var/log

The main differences lie in package management systems and certain configuration file locations. Debian-based distros use .deb packages and tools like apt, while Red Hat-based distros use .rpm packages and tools like yum or dnf.
